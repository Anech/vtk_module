Research Computing Services, IT Services, University of Manchester.

Prerequisites:

RealityGrid Steering Library

CMake (see below) will find the Steering library on your machine if it
has been installed in /usr/local or if you set the environment
variable REG_HOME or REG_STEER_HOME to the path containing the lib and
bin directories of the install or build.

You can also input the path by hand into CMake.

Visualization Toolkit (VTK) 5.0 (or later)

CMake (see below) will find VTK if it is in your PATH or if an
environment variable called VTK_DIR is set to the path containing the
lib and bin directories of VTK.

You can also input the path by hand into CMake.

CMake

The Steering library wrappers are built with an Open Source tool
called CMake available from Kitware, Inc. It is available from here:
http://www.cmake.org/ and is provided in a number of different
flavours including Win32, Mac OS X, IRIX, AIX, Linux and source code.

The Steering Library Wrappers require CMake version 2.6 or later.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How to build and install:

Please see the instructions that come with the Steering Library for
how to use CMake.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Steering Library VTK Module Options.

Some of these options will only be visible in "advanced mode".

REGVTK_INSTALL_TO_REG_DIR - default OFF

If this is set to ON CMake will set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to match that
which was used to install the Steering Library. This will ensure that
the wrappers are installed to the same locations as the Steering
Library.
